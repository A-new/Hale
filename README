Howto add modules, the current module API work as follow:

1) Implement module, for example:

# ircModule.py - example module
import moduleManager
        
class IRC(threading.Thread):

   def __init__(self, config):
       self.config = config
       
   def run(self):
       print "Starting irc bot"
       ...
       while (True):
       # Do some stuff
       
@moduleManager.register("irc")
def handle_config(config):
    """
    Function to register modules, simply 
    implement this to pass along the config
    and starting the module thread
    """
    
    IRC(config).start()

Add decorator for the register function which will be called with 
the configuration as parameter. This function can be named anything.
Pass along the configurations you are going to use from the 
dictionary 'config', the configHandler catches KeyErrors so if wrong 
configurations are sent to this function, configHandler will notify 
you about it.

Also follow the naming convention
nameModule.py and @moduleManager.register("name") and import
the moduleManager, if not the moduleManager will notify 
you about any errors.

2) Add the file to the modules directory. The moduleManager will
then automatically import it and check for errors.

3) In modules.conf, edit the configuration, in this case:

# name a section, can be anything as long as its unique
[myIrcConf]
nick = SpyBot
channel = #irc
...
etc.
