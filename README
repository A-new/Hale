Howto add modules, the current module API work as follow:

1) Implement module, for example:

import moduleManager, threading
from utils import moduleInterface
from utils import threadManager

@moduleManager.register("irc")
def module_setup(config):
    """
    Function to register modules, simply
    implement this to pass along the config
    to the module object and return it back
    """
    
    return IRC(config)

# must inherit from Module class
class IRC(moduleInterface.Module):

   def __init__(self, config):
       self.config = config
       self.continueThread = True
       self.tm = threadManager.ThreadManager()
       threading.Thread.__init__ (self)
   
   # must be implemented
   def doStop(self):
       self.continueThread = False
   
   # must be implemented
   def run(self):
       try:
           # setup sockets
       except Exception:
           self.tm.putError("Error connecting", self)
       ...
       while (self.continueThread):
           try:
               # Log etc
           except Exception:
               self.tm.putError("Error during connection", self)

Add decorator for the register function (in this case module_setup)
which will be called with the current configuration as argument. This 
function can be named anything. Pass along the configurations to the 
module object, the configHandler catches KeyErrors so if wrong 
configurations are sent to this function configHandler will notify 
you about it. 

Also follow the naming convention nameModule.py and @moduleManager.register("name") 
and import the moduleManager, if not the moduleManager will notify 
you about any errors.

Catch all possible exceptions and send them to the thread manager
error bucket which takes care of all errors from every thread 
running in the monitor system. 

2) Drag the file to the modules directory. The moduleManager will
then automatically import it and check for errors.

3) In modules.conf edit the configuration, in this case:

# name a section, can be anything as long as its unique
# and add module regname (in this case irc) as module option
[myIrcConf]
module = irc
nick = SpyBot
channel = #irc
...
etc.
